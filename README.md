# GitHub Contribution Art ‚Äì WILLFREED1

üü© A Bash script that draws the name `WILLFREED1` on your GitHub contribution graph using backdated commits.

All commits are precisely aligned with GitHub‚Äôs 2022 calendar. You can also customize the design to draw hearts ‚ù§Ô∏è, stars ‚≠ê, logos, or your own name.

## üõ† How It Works

- Uses a 7√óN pixel matrix (N ‚â§ 52 columns for 52 weeks)
- Each `"1"` in the matrix creates **5 commits** for darker green
- Commits are backdated using `GIT_AUTHOR_DATE` and `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE`
- The script pushes to the `main` branch to reflect on your profile

---

## üñå Customize the Drawing

You can modify the `MATRIX` in `contribution-art.sh` to draw **anything**.

### Example: Heart ‚ù§Ô∏è

```bash
declare -a MATRIX=(
  "01100110"
  "11111111"
  "11111111"
  "01111110"
  "00111100"
  "00011000"
  "00000000"
)
